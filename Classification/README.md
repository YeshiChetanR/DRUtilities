Ascension UI test automation
****************************

This project is Selenium Webdriver with Java using Page Object Pattern to make resuable components.
We are also using RestAssured Library to make REST calls for testdata creation. The aim is to use pure and pristine cases for case related actions to maintain states. The test runner is TestNG.

To contribute :

You can fork the project and open it in Eclipse (Preferable)/another IDE of your choice. Add testNG and Maven2Eclipse plugins in your Eclipse for easy import and debugging. To check whether your system is setup correctly right click on a test in your project explorer and run as TestNG test. It should open the browser and start executing the test. 

Firefox is setup as default local browser and Chrome runs as standalone selenium container in a separate box.

The only prerequisite for this project on your system is Java (Tested on openjdk version "1.8.0_111"
) and Maven (3.3.9). 

ping dkoul or skarale on #pcm if you face any installation issues.
